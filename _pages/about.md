<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm now working on the **application of computer graphics and robotics technologies in the medical field**. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [lfzhulf@gmail.com](mailto:lfzhulf@gmail.com).

I graduated from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University (复旦大学数学科学学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the [Graphics Lab of EECS](https://www.graphics.pku.edu.cn/xztd/index.htm), Peking University (北京大学图形与交互技术实验室) with a Ph.D.'s degree. Following my doctoral studies, I held postdoctoral research positions at The University of Tokyo and the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I also served as a visiting scholar at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

I won the First Prize for the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China Science and Technology Progress Award (教育部科技进步一等奖), the First Prize for the Jiangsu Institution of Engineers Scientific and Technological Achievement Award, and a Best Paper Award at [The 21st Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, Pacific Graphics 2013](https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/igarashi/en/projects/SoftFolding/index.html). I am also proud to have mentored students who have achieved national top honors, such as the National Special Prize in the "Challenge Cup" competition (挑战杯大学生课外学术科技作品竞赛特等奖) and First Prize in national robotics and artificial intelligence competitions.

My research interests primarily lie in Computer-Aided Design and Simulation, Robot Design and Control, and Haptic Perception and Interaction. To date, I have led or been significantly involved in 10+ national and provincial-level projects, including those under the National Key R&D Program of China.

In the fields of computer graphics and robotics, I have published 50+ papers in renowned journals such as [TOG](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tog), [TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945), [TRO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8860), [RAL](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l), [TOH](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh) and at top international conferences such as [Siggraph](https://s2024.siggraph.org/), [VR](https://ieeevr.org/2025/), [CHI](https://chi2025.acm.org/), [UIST](https://uist.acm.org/2023/), [ICRA](https://www.icra2023.org/).
